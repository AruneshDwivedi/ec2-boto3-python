## Project Workflow

1. Connect Python to AWS using boto3
2. Launch EC2 instance using configuration
3. Wait until instance is running
4. Fetch public and private IP
5. Print instance details

---
## Output

* New EC2 instance created
* Instance ID displayed
* Public and Private IP printed

---

## Key Concepts
